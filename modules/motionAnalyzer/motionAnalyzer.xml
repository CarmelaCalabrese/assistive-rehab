   This module is responsible for analyzing the performed movement in real-time.
   It computes the range of motion (ROM) for range of motion movements and the speed of the end-point for reaching movements, which can be visualized on a yarpscope.
   Each movement is identified by a group (ROM for range of motion and EP for end-point) and a tag, and described through a reference joint, a reference direction and a plane.
   The ROM is computed as angle between the vector formed by the reference joint and its child (projected onto the projection plane) and the reference direction.
   These information are avaliable in the config file motion-repertoire.ini, which contains relevant information for \ref skeletonScaler, \ref actionRecognizer and \feedbackProducer.
   The tag of the movment has to match the name of the file loaded by \ref skeletonPlayer and the label of the classed predicted by \ref actionRecognizer.
   The module is also responsible for generating matio files in order to produce an offline report.
   It makes use of matio and hdf5 libraries.
