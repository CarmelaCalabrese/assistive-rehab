   This module retrieves the selected 3D skeleton from \ref objectsPropertiesCollector and sends the upper body 2D keypoints (x,y) (ankles and knees discarded), observed in a predefined window, to a pretrained LSTM.
   The retrieved skeleton is normalized and keypoints are transformed and rescaled by a factor of 10 (same operations were performed during training). When the window is full, the network outputs the label of the predicted action.
   Predicted actions are accumulated for a (settable) number of times, and the label of the most voted action is provided as output.
   The adopted classes are defined in the config.ini file.
   It makes use of TensorFlowCC.
