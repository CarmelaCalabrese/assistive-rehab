This application has been developed during the first semester of 2018 with the aim of starting implementing the features required to support R1 as artificial assistant of the physiotherapist. The fundamental aspects considered are the following:

1. R1 engages the user, proposing a rehabilitative exercise of the upper limbs, chosen from a predefined repertoire;
2. the exercise the user has to perform is shown on the screen, through a template skeleton;
3. R1 analyzes in real-time the execution of the exercise, providing a verbal feedback limited to three levels of quality of the movement;
4. the analyzed metric is updated in real-time and shown on the screen;
5. R1 processes a final report of the exercise which includes the information acquired during the interaction;
6. R1 keeps engaging a user, proposing movements from the repertoire which have not been proposed before, by using face recognition and stored data related to past interactions;
7. the physical interaction between R1 and the patient is limited to the motion of R1's head.
